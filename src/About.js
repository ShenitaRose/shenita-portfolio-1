        <p>
          Hello World! I'm Shenita Rose, a Front-End Web Developer based in
          London. From psychology classes at the University of Greenwich to
          witing code, I found the one thing that i am truly passionate
          about,Web Development.I love creating user friendly web pages that are
          not only eye-catching but easily accessible and user friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase of inclusivity and diversity in the industry through
          representation is one of the main reasons why I enjoy coding even
          more.I truly believe that mindfulness in the workplace is a key to success which is why outside of work I enjoy  taking long walks and the
          occasional yoga(I only know 2 poses ðŸ˜Š ).My other Hobbies include Gaming and Digital Art{" "}
        </p>
       
        <p>
          I am absolutely excited to make the leap and continue to refine my
          skills with the right company. If perseverance and Grit is what you
          are looking for, drop me a line in the contact section of this
          portfolio.{" "}
