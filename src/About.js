          Hello World! I'm Shenita Rose, a Front-End Web Developer based in
          London. From psychology classes at the University of Greenwich to
          witing code, I found the one thing that i am truly passionate
          about,Web Development.I love creating user friendly web pages that are
          not only eye-catching but easily accessible and user friendly. The
          increase of inclusivity and diversity in the industry through
          representation is one of the main reasons why I enjoy coding even
          more.I truly believe that mindfulness in the workplace is a key to
          success which is why outside of work I enjoy taking long walks and the
          occasional yoga(I only know 2 poses ðŸ˜Š ).My other Hobbies include
          Gaming and Digital Art I am absolutely excited to make the leap and
          continue to refine my skills with the right company. If perseverance
          and Grit is what you are looking for, drop me a line in the contact
          section of this portfolio.{" "}
